For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a website that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

## Guidelines

Your team must adhere to the following requirements:

- Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Your website must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation, one of which must be an "About Us" page
- Your website must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
- Your website's state must persist between page reloads.
- Your website must be deployed live on the Internet at the time of project presentations.
- You will have a daily individual project report to submit via Canvas.
- Your team will do a standup meeting every morning with the instructional team (or some subset thereof)

## Process

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week:

- On the first day of project week, your team must submit a plan to the instruction team
- During project week, your team must work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
- Each day, each team will to a 5-10 minute standup meeting with the instructional staff.
- Each team should engage in user testing by inviting people to sit down and interact with your site. This will help your UI/UX immensely.
- On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class, using the deployed version of the project.

## Project Plan

Your project plan document may be presented either on paper or electronically. It can be presented on a whiteboard, however must be highly organized and clear.

The project plan document should contain the following information:

- Your team's name (if you want one)
- Your team's members
- Your project's name and concept
- Summary of how team plans to address details in the problem domain
- Component diagrams for each page
    - Sketches/wire frames of your project's pages
    - Boxes for components
    - Data (State)
        - List of things that change
        - Derived data
    - Component Tree Diagrams
        - Tree of Components
        - State Owner(s)
        - Data Flow
        - Events Up
- NOTE: You should not be writing any code prior to the approval of the project plan.
- TIP: Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch, or the whiteboard. Online tools look snazzy but take some time to learn.

## Launch phase

Here are some suggestions on how to organize your team during the launch phase:

- Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following.
- Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
- Hosting the code under their GitHub account.
- The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following.
- Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
- Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.

### GitHub

- Create a new Git Organization for the team
- Add team members as admins
- Initialize a new Repository
- Clone locally

### Launch

**Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new project:**

- Build a basic scaffold, such as the following, from scratch as a team:
- README.md
- LICENSE
- index.html
- any other HTML files go at this level
- css/
  - reset.css
  - style.css
  - style2.css, etc.
- js/
  - app.js
  - app2.js
  - app-data.js

Once all these pieces are wired up together:

- Push it to GitHub

## Development phase

Now that your project is launched, here's how to organize the development efforts of your team. Your goal is to have the entire work plan for the project planned and organized, down to the finest details, before you begin any coding:

- Use GitHub Issues or a tool like waffle.io or Trello to manage and divide up the work between your team members. This planning is essential.
- Create new issues that'll take approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours (max!) to complete.
- Use labels and milestones as your team sees fit, but leave all newly created issues unassigned.
- Assign an issue to yourself when you commit to working on it.
- Each feature should be built on its own branch. Think of each of the issues above as a feature.
- Once assigned, create a branch using a following naming scheme such as the following:
- Imagine issue '#1' is titled "Add an about.html page".
- The branch name would be add_about_page.
- Push the commits on your branch to GitHub regularly.
- Create a Pull Request for your branch even if you're unsure if it'll be merged into master.
- Ask someone else on your team to review the code in your Pull Request.
- If changes are required, make them on your branch and push them to GitHub for another review.
- Once satisfied, let the reviewer merge your Pull Request. Don't merge your own Pull Request.

### Outcome First

1. Focus on static HTML/CSS Representation _first_.
1. Then bring in dynamic data, events, etc.

### Known Good State

1. Keep in clean!
1. Incrementalism
1. Not a goal to obtain, but a place to never leave

## Presentation

On the last day of project week, your team will have 15-20 minutes to present your project in front of the class:

- Explain your project's problem domain and your team's solution.
- Explain the challenges that arose during project week and how your team overcame them.
- Each person should handle part of the presentation. More details will be coming on this as we get closer to the day of presentations.

## Grading

Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit:

- Individual effort is graded based on links to commits and Pull Requests that demonstrate your contributions.
- Technical merit is graded based on the following criteria.
- Good and proper use of HTML
- Clear, readable, and efficient structure
- Uses semantic markup whenever possible
- Good and proper use of CSS
- Clear, readable, and efficient styles
- Good and proper use of JavaScript
- Clear, readable, and efficient code
- Uses domain models to encapsulate data and behavior
- Contains no unnecessary code, including console.log messages
- Passes the linter
- Generally useful and functional
- Works as expected with no bugs
- Has at least 3 interlinked pages with a clear navigation
- Has at least two pages that accept and process user input
- State is persisted between page reloads
- Deployed live on the Internet
- Submitting this assignment

Please submit this Canvas assignment with answers to the following questions after your team's presentation:

- Describe your individual contributions to the team and project.
- Share links to commits or Pull Requests that demonstrate your contributions.
- What are you most proud of?
- What would have done differently?
- What lessons did you learn from this experience?

## Congratulations!

Thanks for all your hard work through this course! We can't wait to see where you go with your new superpowers. :-)
